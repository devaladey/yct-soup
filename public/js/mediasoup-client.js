// This file should be a placeholder for the mediasoup-client library
// In a real implementation, you would include the library from CDN or a node_modules folder
// For this example, we'll point to a CDN version of the library

// Note: In production, use the following:
// <script src="https://unpkg.com/mediasoup-client@3/dist/mediasoup-client.min.js"></script>
